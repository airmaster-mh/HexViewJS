HexViewJS
=========

Overview
--------

A simple javascript library for rendering binary data into nicely formatted HTML reminiscent of a hex viewer.  The library came into being after I was writing some documentation that required showing binary file contents in a HTML document and I couldn't find a library on google.  I needed a project to put into practice some javascript and jquery I had been learning and it was a good fit.
