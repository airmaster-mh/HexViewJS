HexEditorJS
===========

Overview
--------

HexEditorJS has default hex viewer feature that based on HexViewJS, as well as the hex editing feature. I was decided to add edit feature to HexEditorJS, because I couldn't find a library that has hex edit feature on google. But HexViewJS's structure does not appropriate to extend features and does not provide enough function for my requirement. So I decided to borrow only the basic concepts of HexViewJS and re-create it.

HexViewJS
=========

Overview
--------

A simple javascript library for rendering binary data into nicely formatted HTML reminiscent of a hex viewer.  The library came into being after I was writing some documentation that required showing binary file contents in a HTML document and I couldn't find a library on google.  I needed a project to put into practice some javascript and jquery I had been learning and it was a good fit.
